Note: the rest of Indexer's `README.md` can be found in the `DESIGN.md` file becasue we seperated markdown files following the instructions for Querier for continuity.

The indexer program accepts two arguments: indexer, pageDirectory, and indexFilename. The pageDirectory is a directory generated by the crawler, where each file is named after a document ID (an integer) and contains the URL of the page, its crawl depth from the source, and its full HTML content. The indexer reads these files, builds an inverted index mapping words to document IDs and word counts, and writes the index to the indexFilename. Additional implementation details are provided in the Indexer Implementation Spec.

## Assumptions

There were no assumptions used beyond the scope of the assignment, outside of assuming all words only consist of alphabetical letters which we indirectly infered from `word.c` instructions.

## Testing

For compiling, the command `make` compiles all files for the indexer. For testing, the command `make test` runs testing.sh. For cleaning, the command `make clean` deletes all files created by the make command.

The test suite includes:
- Invalid argument tests (wrong count, invalid pageDirectory, invalid indexFilename)
- Valid indexing tests with different page directories
- Tests to verify index file format
- Tests comparing output to expected index files

## Known Failures

There are no known failures we are aware of with the indexer.
