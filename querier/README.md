##

The querier program accepts three arguments: querier, pageDirectory, and indexFilename. The pageDirectory is a directory generated by the crawler, where each file is named after a document ID (an integer) and contains the URL of the page, its crawl depth from the source, and its full HTML content. The indexFilename is produced by the indexer and contains an inverted index, with each line representing a unique word followed by pairs of docID and the corresponding word count within that document. Additional implementation details are provided in the Querier Implementation Spec.

## Assumptions

There were no assumptions used beyond the scope of the assignment.

## Testing

For compiling, the command `make` compiles all files for the querier. For testing, the command `make test` runs testing.sh. For cleaning, the command `make clean` deletes all files created by the make command.

The test suite includes:
- Invalid argument tests
- Invalid query tests  
- Valid query tests with letters dataset
- Tests with toscrape dataset
- Valgrind memory tests (8 tests ordered by complexity)

## Known Failures

There are no known failures we are aware of with the querier.
